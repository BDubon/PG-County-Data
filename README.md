## Documentation

### Requirements
- Make sure these are installed in your machine
    ```
    git
    node
    npm
    ```

### Running The App
- In a terminal, and in the directory you want to save the project, clone the repo 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BDubon/PG-County-Data.git
    ```

- Install all the dependencies with the command
    ```
    npm install
    ```

- After all dependencies have been installed, start the server
    ```
    npm run dev    
    ```

- You should now be able to see the app in a web browser at the address
    ```
    localhost:5000
    ```


### Other Comments
- `nodemon` automatically tracks changes once a file is saved, so there's no need to shutdown and restart the server. However, the web page will need to be refreshed to see the new changes.
